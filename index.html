				<p>As a short get to know me, I'm trans male, who enjoys wasting my life away playing games, talking to people, animating (work in progress), and just overall I enjoy being able to help others, and make people laugh, and if it's because I'm raging because I'm throwing my controller/mouse across the room and screaming at the top of my lungs, so be it. Feel free to join the community, and ask questions, I'd be happy to answer any questions, or just talk in general. Much love :D</p>
